The table provides land, water and total area measurements for the 50 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico and the Island Areas.  The area measurements were derived from the Census Bureau's Master Address File/Topologically Integrated Geographic Encoding and Referencing (MAF/TIGER®) database. The boundaries of the states and equivalent areas are as of January 1, 2010. The land and water areas, including their classifications, reflect base feature updates made in the MAF/TIGER® database through August, 2010.  The area measurements, in square kilometers and square miles, are for statistical purposes only.

The ANSI standard for converting square kilometers into square miles was used ( 1 square mile = 2.58998811 square kilometers).

Notes:
Urban population percentages are not directly comparable over time due to changes in definitions and criteria for delineating urban areas.
-	Definition 1 (1900-1940):  Urban comprised all territory in incorporated places of 2,500 or more.  In addition, some areas were classified as urban under special rules relating to population size and density.
-	Definition 2 (1950-1990):  Urban included all population in "urbanized areas" (densely settled territory with specific population thresholds), and incorporated places or Census Designated Places (CDPs) with population of 2,500 or more located outside of urbanized areas.
-	Definition 3 (2000-2010):  Urban included all population in urbanized areas and urban clusters (each with their own population size and density thresholds).
